# Mac OS X Setup Guide

This book serves as a guide for how I set up my work environment on Macintosh. All instructions covered assume you are setting up OS X Yosemite. Setting up a new Mac takes days to complete and is impossible to remember. The goal of this book is to make that process more efficient.
